# CaMKII_Simulation
This is a python script to simulate CaMKII activation. 
* The result was published in "Mechanisms of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II activation in single dendritic spines" (Chang et al., 2019, Nature Communications). 
* To generate Fig. 6C of Chang et al paper, run CaMKII_SimRev.py. 
* To generate Fig. 7b, run Script_T286Mutation.py. 
* To geenrate Fig. 7d, run Script_STDP.py. PDF files were the results of the simulations. 
* Any comments or bugs, please email me (Ryohei.yasuda@mpfi.org).
